# Copilot Instruction File: Dance Platform Project

# Project Overview:
# Full-stack dance platform using .NET REST API (Entity Framework + PostgreSQL) and Angular v22 frontend.
# Deployment target: Raspberry Pi OS, PostgreSQL service, .NET API as systemd service, Angular served via Apache2 reverse proxy.
# Design style: warm and energetic. No emojis.

# General Rules:
- Follow SOLID and DRY principles.
- Only add comments when necessary for clarity or complex logic.
- Use Entity Framework migrations for database setup.
- Use proper REST conventions for backend endpoints.
- Ensure database relationships: many-to-many for Dance↔Style and User↔Dance (favorites/learned), one-to-many for Dance↔Video.
- All database entries include dateAdded field.
- Implement search functionality for dances by name or style.
- Frontend: handle video playback for YouTube, with adjustable speed and repeat region.

# Backend (.NET REST API):
- Implement login with username/password (hashed), prepare for OAuth later.
- Provide endpoints for:
    - CRUD for Dances, Videos, Styles
    - User authentication and profile
    - Favorites and learned dances
    - Search/filter dances
- Use Entity Framework for PostgreSQL.
- Ensure proper validation and error handling.
- Profile fields: name, nickname, avatar, dances learned/interested, visibility (public/private).

# Frontend (Angular v22):
- Implement login and profile pages.
- Display dances by style and allow browsing/favoriting/marking as learned.
- Video player must support speed adjustment and repeat region.
- Warm and energetic design. No emojis.
- Keep code modular: components, services, models properly organized.

# Deployment Instructions (Raspberry Pi):
- Install PostgreSQL and initialize database.
- Deploy .NET API as systemd service.
- Deploy Angular via Apache2 with reverse proxy to .NET API.
- Include setup commands for packages, services, and enabling reverse proxy.

# Output Requirements:
- Full project folder structure for backend and frontend.
- Entity Framework migration scripts.
- Angular components, services, models, and modules.
- README with development and deployment instructions.
- SQL and API examples matching the REST endpoints.
